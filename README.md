## Hi there ðŸ‘‹

Welcome to my GitHub repository!

Iâ€™m a full-stack developer with hands-on experience in building scalable, high-performing web applications using Vue.js on the frontend and Node.js on the backend. This repository is a collection of projects, tools, and experiments that showcase my approach to developing modern, maintainable, and efficient full-stack solutions.

On the frontend, I focus on creating dynamic and responsive user interfaces using Vue.js, along with Vuex for managing application state. I enjoy building component-based UI architectures that are both reusable and easy to maintain, while paying close attention to performance, usability, and responsiveness across devices.

For backend development, I use Node.js to build robust RESTful APIs and services, often working with Express.js to streamline routing, middleware, and request handling. My projects commonly integrate PostgreSQL as the database of choice, where I design and optimize schemas, manage relational data, and write performant queries that scale with application demands.

I also work with tools like Docker, Git, and various testing frameworks to ensure clean development workflows and reliable deployments. Iâ€™m always learning and applying best practices in authentication, error handling, data validation, and overall code quality.

This repository includes a mix of full-stack applications, backend services, and frontend components that reflect real-world functionality. Whether you're exploring best practices, learning full-stack development, or looking for collaborative opportunities, I hope these projects offer value and inspiration.

Feel free to browse through the code, fork a project, or reach out with feedback or ideas. I'm always open to connecting with other developers and contributing to meaningful, practical solutions.

Thanks for visiting, and stay tuned for more updates as I continue to build and refine full-stack applications with Vue.js, Node.js, and PostgreSQL.
